#Credits: COVID-19 Lockdown - Day 23

Python Socket Implementation of Command and Control Bot.
Data traffic between bot and control encrypted with bare implementation of Diffie Hellman Asymmetric Secret Key and 
authenticaiton code with inbuilt AES crypto library.
Simple joy of writing a bare diffie hellman cryptography algorithm.
